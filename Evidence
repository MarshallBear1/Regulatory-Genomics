Thap11
THAP11 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor in Gastric Cancer through Regulating c-Myc Signaling Pathways. 
A transcriptional repressor network including THAP domain containing 11 protein (THAP11) was identified and negatively regulates endogenous PARKIN abundance.
Could mutation in THAP11 lead to cancer as seen with defects in BRAC1?
